#LEARNING HTML

As a part of my COMP4060 Continuing Professional Developement project, I wish to learn JavaScript. 
However, I've soon discovered that HTML is a prerequisite for JavaScript. 

This repository records my progress with learning HTML from https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp
It also serves as practice for my git repository management skills.
