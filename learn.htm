    <h1>Learning HTML</h1>
    <p>Thus began the journey of learning HTML! Woohoo!</p>

    <h2>Running the code</h2>
    <p>HTML code can be run with any browser.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings ranges from h1 to h6 (most to least important).</p>
    
    <h2>HTML Links</h2>
    <p>Here is a link to <a href ="https://www.google.com.au">Google.</a></p>

    <h2>HTML Images</h2>
    <p>HTML images are defined by the img tag with the following attributes:
        <br>scr = source file
        <br>alt = alternative text if img cannot be displayed
        <br>width and height.
        <br>Below is a picture of a black chicken.
    </p>
    <img src="C:\Users\David\Desktop\COMP4060\COMP4060 CPD Project\Learning HTML\Black_Cock.jpg" 
    alt="Error: Black Chicken not found!! (Oh no!)" 
    width="250" height="250">
    <br>
    <img src="Good_Chicken.jpg" 
    alt="Error: A chicken as good as this one cannot be found!! (Oh no!)" 
    width="250" height="250">


    <h2>Viewing HTML Source Code</h2>
    <p>Right click in a html page and select "View Source".</p>
    <p>You can also inspect element to see both html and CSS elements</p>



    <h1>HTML Elelments</h1>
    <p>These are everything between two <> tags.</p>

    <h2>Empty HTML Elements</h2>
    <p> = HTML elements with no content. <br> Some of them don't need a closing tag. <br> br (linebreak) is one of them</p>

    <h2>HTML tags are not case sensitive</h2>
    <p>But lowercase is recommended.</p>


    <h1>HTML attributes</h1>
    <p>HTML elements can have attributes like name = "value"</p>

    <p>For src, instead of using absolute URL, use Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within 
        <br>the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it 
        <br>will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, 
        <br>it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
